From Cahir:

Let me apologize all of you that waited so long for the release. I'm not going
to explain all of the reasons behind such a delay, but will try to shed some
light on it. The root problem was that I did not own MC68060 turbo card at the
time of writing the demo and the only test platform we had was WinUAE. Whilst
the code quality produced by GCC 2.95.3 is generally good, GCC is still not
well suited to write CPU intensive rendering loops. During the party we
learned that our production was unacceptably slow on the real hardware.
Consequently I spent several weeks rewriting some loops in assembly and
optimizing CPU intensive parts, but again we still were missing the hardware.
Eventually Gorzyga/Decree helped us to test the optimized code on his
68060/62. I'd like to thank him right now, for his share in closing the
release version :)

Compared to party version we've got about 50% performance improvement (on
average). Almost every piece of rendering code has been somehow altered. We
changed loading screen to copyright free image (previously KS 3.1 boot screen)
and corrected one texture / palette (the one under rotating translucent
object).
